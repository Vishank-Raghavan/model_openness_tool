# Maintainers of the Model Openness Tool (MOT) project

Maintainers are responsible for day-to-day operation of the
project. Every pull request in this repository must be approved by
at least one Maintainer.

This file contains the canonical list of MOT Maintainers. It is
manually mirrored to the Maintainers GitHub team, which confers
permissions in this repository.

### Becoming a Maintainer

The criteria for becoming a Maintainer are as follows:

-   Demonstrated track record of PR reviews (both quality and quantity)
-   Demonstrated track record of PR submissions (both quality and quantity)
-   Demonstrated thought leadership in the project
-   Demonstrated shepherding of project work and contributors

The best way to get started is to regularly contribute and review pull requests.

To nominate a candidate, send a PR adding the candidate's name to the list of
[Current Maintainers]. If the candidate is not the author, have the candidate
approve the PR as well.

Once the PR is approved and merged, an existing Maintainer will add the
candidate to the Maintainers GitHub team.

### Removing a Maintainer

Maintainers may be removed by explicit resignation, for prolonged inactivity
(e.g. 3 or more months with no review comments), for some infraction of the code
of conduct, or for consistently demonstrating poor judgment. A proposed removal
also requires a majority approval. A Maintainer removed for inactivity may be
restored following a sustained resumption of contributions and reviews (a month
or more) demonstrating a renewed commitment to the project.

To remove a Maintainer, send a PR to move the candidate from [Current
Maintainers] to [Retired Maintainers]. If the candidate is not the author,
request review from the candidate to inform them of their removal. Approval from
the candidate is *not* required, though it is desirable.

Once the PR is approved and merged, a Maintainer will remove the person from
the Maintainers GitHub team.
